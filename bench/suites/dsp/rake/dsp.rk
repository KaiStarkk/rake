   DSP is ideal for SIMD because:
   - Streaming data with regular access patterns
   - FIR/IIR filters are multiply-accumulate heavy
   - FFT has predictable data shuffling

   TODO:
   - Implement FIR filter with coefficient racks
   - Implement biquad IIR filter
   - Add windowing functions (Hann, Hamming)
   - Process audio blocks of 8 samples at a time

(* STUB: Mandelbrot set computation in Rake *)
(*
   The Mandelbrot set is a classic SIMD benchmark because:
   - Complex number arithmetic maps well to SIMD
   - Iteration counts vary per pixel (tests lane masking)
   - Memory access is regular (tests prefetching)

   TODO:
   - Define complex number operations: add, mul, magnitude
   - Implement escape iteration with rail-based early exit
   - Process 8 pixels at a time (AVX2)
   - Output iteration counts as image data
*)

rake compute_iteration : float rack -> float rack -> int rack -> int rack =
  fun cr ci max_iter ->
    0  (* Placeholder *)

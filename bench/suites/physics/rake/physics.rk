   Physics simulation tests:
   - Rigid body dynamics
   - Collision detection (AABB, sphere-sphere)
   - Constraint solving
   - Contact response

   TODO:
   - Implement AABB overlap test with rails
   - Sphere-sphere collision with response
   - Process 8 collision pairs in parallel
   - Integrate positions with constraints
